When you execute your program, it is already in machine language.\n",

    "\n",
    "So, Jupyter is an extension of IPython the pushes interactive computing further. It is language agnostic as its name suggests.  The name \"Jupyter\" is a combination of [Julia](http://julialang.org/) (a new language for scientific computing), [Python](http://python.org/) (which you know and love), and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (the dominant tool for statistical computation).  However, you can run over 40 different languages in a JupyterLab, not just Julia, Python, and R.\n",
    "\n",

You can always import those modules when you are using a Jupyter notebook (more on modules and importing them later in the bootcamp). So, a Jupyter notebook is not good for an application where you are building reusable code or scripts. However, Jupyter notebooks are **very** useful in the following applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Exploring data/analysis.* Jupyter notebooks are great for trying things out with code, or exploring a data set. This is an important part of the research process. The layout of Jupyter notebooks is great for organizing thoughts as you synthesize them.\n",
    "2. *Sharing your thinking in your analysis.* Because you can combine nicely formatted text and executable code, Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing how you go about doing your calculations with collaborators and with readers of your publications. Famously, LIGO used [a Jupyter notebook](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html) to explain the signal processing involved in their first discovery of a gravitational wave.\n",

    "A code cell contains actual code that you want to run.  You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar of your Jupyter notebook.  Otherwise, you can can hit `Esc` and then `y` (denoted `Esc - y`\") while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell.  Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit `Enter` while holding down the `Shift` key (denoted `Shift + Enter`).  Note that code cells are executed in the order you shift-enter them. That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit `Shift + Enter` is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter. **This is a very important point and is often a source of confusion and frustration for students.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text. The text is written in **markdown**, a lightweight markup language. You can read about its syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Note that you can also insert HTML into markdown cells, and this will be rendered properly. As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting `Shift + Enter` renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting `Esc - m` in the cell.  Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",

    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can click the `+` icon on the notebook toolbar. The shortcut to insert a cell below is `Esc - b` and to insert a cell above is `Esc - a`. Alternatively, you  can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting `Alt + Enter`."
